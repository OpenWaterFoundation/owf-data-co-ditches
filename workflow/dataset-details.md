## Overview ##

This dataset contains GeoJSON feature layers for Colorado irrigation ditches (alignment, not service areas).
The files are generated from the DWR Irrigation Ditches layer from
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems](https://cdss.colorado.gov/gis-data/gis-data-by-category)
for geographic areas that are typically used in analysis and visualizations.

**The dataset is incomplete and only contains ditches for Divisions 2 (Arkansas) and 4 (Gunnison).**
